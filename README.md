UrlRewriteFilter
================

Fork of [UrlRewriteFilter][1] by Paul Tuckey, based on https://github.com/wvuong/urlrewritefilter who thankfully already converted it to Git/GitHub

Adds better logging - i.e. logs successful rewrite on INFO level. The standard implementation does log nothing on INFO and ich very verbose on DEBUG level.
